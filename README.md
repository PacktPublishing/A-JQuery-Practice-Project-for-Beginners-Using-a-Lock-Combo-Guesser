## About the Video Course
This course will show you how to build an interactive web application from scratch using jQuery and JavaScript. You will learn by working on a project, by building an interactive mini game. The game itself includes an interface with three numbers that users need to guess. After updating the numbers, they take a guess at the combination; the return shows whether the guess is low or high or their number is correct. All the logic and interactivity are supplied by jQuery and JavaScript. You'll walk through building a web application from scratch, focusing on gaining experience with jQuery. You'll use jQuery for everything, including the CSS. You'll work along with the lessons and experiment with the code; the source code is included. By the end of the course, you'll have produced a fully functional mini application.
